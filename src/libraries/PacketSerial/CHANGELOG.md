and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Removed
- Remove the `void begin(unsigned long speed, size_t port)` function.
- Remove the `void begin(Stream* stream)` function.
- `while(!SerialX)` line when `CORE_TEENSY` is defined. This was leading to unexpected behavior where programs would not start until a serial connection was opened.

### Added
- Lambda function packetHandler examples and documentation.

### Changed
- Updated README.md, fixed spelling error, added links, docs.

## [1.2.0] 2017-11-09
### Added
- An additional PacketHandler pointer type that includes the sender's pointer e.g. `void onPacketReceived(const void* sender, const uint8_t* buffer, size_t size)`. Either functions can be set. Calling `setPacketHandler()` will always remove all previous function pointers.
-

### Removed
- Deprecated all but one basic `void begin(Stream* stream)` function. Use `void setStream(Stream* stream)` instead.
- Reverted void `PacketSerial_::begin(unsigned long speed, uint8_t config, size_t port)`.

### Changed
- Updated README.md, fixed errors, spelling and updated examples.


## [1.1.0] 2017-11-09
### Added
- Additional inline documentation.
- Added doxygen configuration file.
- Added CHANGELOG.md file.
- Added the `void PacketSerial_::begin(unsigned long speed, uint8_t config, size_t port)` method to avoid confusion with the standard `Serial.begin(unsigned long speed, uint8_t config)`.

### Changed
- Updated README.md, fixed errors, spelling, byte counts, etc.
- Updated documentation / comments in documentation for clarity.

### Removed
- Deprecated the `void begin(unsigned long speed, size_t port)` method because it could be confused with the standard `Serial.begin(unsigned long speed, uint8_t config)` method.

### Fixed
- Fixed Duplicated SLIP END Packet #[11](https://github.com/bakercp/PacketSerial/issues/11)
- Fix types to remove warnings in examples.
- Add `const` qualifier to the `send()` method.

### Security
- None
