/*! \brief Simulate I2C I/O expanders
 *
 * This class connects to arduino-mock's I2C (Wire) support and
 * intercepts writes to the simulated I2C bus, emulating a pair of
 * MCP23008 I/O expanders.
 *
 * Of the MCP23008 protocol, only the bare minimum necessary to support
 * GPIO writes is implemented.
 *
 * The current GPIO state can be retrieved at any time by calling
 * gpioState(). The result is the state of the 16 digital outputs,
 * in the order that they are normally connected to the knitting
 * machine's solenoids, i.e. starting from the leftmost solenoid.
 *
 * Note that a KH270 machine only has 12 solenoids, but since this
 * class simulates the I/O expanders, that always have 16 outputs,
 * that fact is not relevant here.
 *
 * Creating an instance of this class takes over WireMock, no expectations
 * should be setup on it from outside until that instance is destroyed
 * and releaseWireMock is called.
