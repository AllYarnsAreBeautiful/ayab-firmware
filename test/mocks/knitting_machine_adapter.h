/**
 * This class connects a KnittingMachine (which does not know anything about
 * testing/mocking, or the AYAB code) to ArduinoMock, so that calls to
 * the relevant Arduino functions (e.g. `digitalRead`) made from the AYAB
 * code will retrieve or set information on the KnittingMachine instance.
 *
 * Note that this class makes no attempt at clean-up (because the gMock
 * API makes this basically impossible), so once it is destroyed,
 * no call should be made to ArduinoMock until releaseArduinoMock()
 * has been called.
